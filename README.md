# functionality
Give a sens to your interactive or non interactive shell...


## to be sourced somewhere...
```shell
git clone https://github.com/752963e64/functionality
cd ./functionality
sudo cp functionality /etc/
sudo echo "source /etc/functionality" >> /etc/bashrc
```

## tasking easier
- demonstrate power :)
- The right way to proceed is to think about usage.

How will "normal" ppl in need will be using it...
- The best features in soft warz distribution, is part of one thing mainly.

It's when you don't need to tweak anything... the default usage fits totally your expectation.


## functionality

## On design...
- I'm fluent in coding like I write text... and It getting the same problems at doing it...

- I can't handle the amount of ideaz... overloading me... unsustainable some times... I just go away.

- I can also choose to write first idea comming out but most of time I end refactoring endlessly :D

- looking the best effect, because nobody rewrite something done correctly!

I may end sclicing functionality to part source/unset ofloading style zZZzzzZZ;

## I been burning in lately :)
I ran into the deep mind... did coding with wired usb keyboard, no radio, no speaker for months...
pretty sick :D but I'm out of it strongher. Here is a subset of the aquired introspection.
It's gonna be fun :)
