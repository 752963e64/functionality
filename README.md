## to be sourced somewhere...
```shell
git clone https://github.com/752963e64/functionality
cd ./functionality
sudo cp functionality /etc/
sudo echo "source /etc/functionality" >> /etc/bashrc
```

## tasking easier
- demonstrate power :)
- The right way to proceed is to think about usage.

How will "normal" ppl in need will be using it...
- The best features in soft warz distribution, is part of one thing mainly.

It's when you don't need to tweak anything... the default usage fits totally your expectation.


## functionality
```shell
# available to root only.
#- config.* ssh, sshd, ssl; let you configure os's config files.
# available to users and root
# * misc tool:
# - text.row.hl <text_file> <optional:color>; output text file line by line with alternate color.
# * environ based:
#- env.* gcc.set, gcc.unset; let you load and unload architecture and architecture tuning through CFLAGS CPPFLAGS and MAKEFLAGS
# (you can add your default options to it following instructions inside function for safety.)

```

## I been burning in lately :)
I ran into the deep mind... did coding with wired usb keyboard, no radio, no speaker for months...
pretty sick :D but I'm out of it strongher. Here is a subset of the aquired introspection.
It's gonna be fun :)
